# Pygen
Pygen is an unofficial interpreter for the esoteric language [Protogen](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Protogen), implemented in Python. While Protogen has an existing Python-based interpreter ([found here](https://github.com/Joseppi007/Protogen/blob/main/protogen.py)), Pygen stands out for its ease of useâ€”well, *relatively* speaking. Given that Protogen isn't exactly designed with user-friendliness in mind, don't expect a totally smooth ride. If you want something truly beginner-friendly, go with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [BASIC](http://www.quitebasic.com/), or most other languages out there ([although definitely not *every* language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge), [as some are even worse](https://esolangs.org/wiki/BrainF)).

## Key Differences
Unlike the official Protogen interpreter, Pygen doesn't require you to manually specify a path to a program file. You can use any of the [example programs](https://github.com/UniqueName12345/Pygen/tree/main/examples) included with Pygen without needing to fuss with file paths.
